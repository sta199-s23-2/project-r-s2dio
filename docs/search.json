Noting Duke mens basketball’s historical successes, we have grown interested in researching more about other Division 1 mens basketball programs in universities throughout the country.\nThe data that we will be utilizing is sourced from the Division I college basketball seasons from the years of 2013-2019. It was found in the open source data site, Kaggle. The data was scraped from http://barttorvik.com/trank.php#. This data was cleaned up in 2021, in which the COVID seasons were not included in the dataset.\nThe dataset has various variables that characterize different Division I basketball teams— such as the university they represent and the conference in which they belong. Some of the observations within the dataset include the number of games played, the number of games won, power rating, as well as the stats of the team in a particular season.\nMethodology\nOur research question: “How does regular season adjusted offensive efficiency, and regular season adjusted defensive efficiency correlate to being a 1-seed team and post season success?”\nOur central research question is addressed through the analysis of the factors that best predict overall regular season success from 2013 to 2019. We might be able to filter out the different factors that play a role in each program’s success and determine their ‘weight’ in assigning regular season rankings. With this we hoe to find teh best predictor for end of regular season seed given the team makes the ncaa tournament (or if the predicted seed is above 16 then they do not make the tournament).\nResults\n– What are you finding out? We are finding out the best correlation between seeds and adjusted offensive efficiency/ adjusted defensive efficiency, as well as finding which predictor is the best (out of adjusted offensive efficiency, adjusted defensive efficiency, or both).\n\n\n\nPlotting The Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFitting Our Models\n\n\nparsnip model object\n\n\nCall:\nstats::lm(formula = SEED ~ ADJOE, data = data)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)        ADJOE  \n    69.9247      -0.5482  \n\n\nparsnip model object\n\n\nCall:\nstats::lm(formula = SEED ~ ADJDE, data = data)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)        ADJDE  \n   -49.5214       0.6034  \n\n\nparsnip model object\n\n\nCall:\nstats::lm(formula = SEED ~ ADJOE * ADJDE, data = data)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)        ADJOE        ADJDE  ADJOE:ADJDE  \n  183.58562     -1.98010     -1.29158      0.01587  \n\n\nparsnip model object\n\n\nCall:\nstats::lm(formula = SEED ~ ADJOE + ADJDE, data = data)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)        ADJOE        ADJDE  \n    13.6156      -0.4317       0.4482  \n\n\nModel1 (predicting seed based on adjusted offensive efficiency)\n\\(\\widehat{SEED} = 69.90 - 0.55*ADJOE\\)\nModel2 (predicting seed based on adjusted defensive efficiency)\n\\(\\widehat{SEED} = -49.52 + 0.60*ADJDE\\)\nModel3 (predicting seed based on adjusted offensive and defensive efficiency [interactive model])\n\\(\\widehat{SEED} = 183.59 - 1.98*ADJOE - 1.29*ADJDE + 0.02*ADJOE*ADJDE\\)\nModel4 (predicting seed based on adjusted offensive and defensive efficiency [additive model])\n\\(\\widehat{SEED} = 13.6156 - 0.43*ADJOE + 0.45*ADJDE\\)\nFinding Adjusted R-Squared\n\n\n\nModel1 (predicting seed based on adjusted offensive efficiency)\n\n\n[1] 0.5544491\n\n\nModel2 (predicting seed based on adjusted defensive efficiency)\n\n\n[1] 0.4853405\n\n\nModel3 (predicting seed based on adjusted offensive and defensive efficiency [interactive model])\n\n\n[1] 0.8094014\n\n\nModel4 (predicting seed based on adjusted offensive and defensive efficiency [additive model])\n\n\n[1] 0.7978154\n\n\nFinding AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)\n\n\n\nModel1 (predicting seed based on adjusted offensive efficiency)\n\n\n[1] 2438.484\n\n\nModel2 (predicting seed based on adjusted defensive efficiency)\n\n\n[1] 2507.12\n\n\nModel3 (predicting seed based on adjusted offensive and defensive efficiency [interactive model])\n\n\n[1] 2036.28\n\n\nModel4 (predicting seed based on adjusted offensive and defensive efficiency [additive model])\n\n\n[1] 2063.377\n\n\nThe interactive model (with both adjusted offensive and defensive efficiency) is the best model with the highest adjusted r -squared value (with the additive model just barely less accurate with a slightly lower adjusted r-squared value and a slightly higher AIC). Adjusted offensive efficiency is the third best predictor closely followed by defensive efficiency (but both are individually less correlated with their seed). This means that between offensive and defensive efficiency is slightly more important when it comes to seeding, but both combined are the most important when it comes to predicting seed. These results do match our hypothesis which again is “We predict that, in regular season, teams with higher adjusted offensive efficiency & lower adjusted defensive efficiency will be predicted to have higher seeds.”"

    "text": "Significant knowledge gaps exist in the main components that create a seeding assignment for Division 1 college basketball teams that make it to the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA), also known as ‘March Madness’. The 64 teams that qualify for the D-1 national championship are assigned to be a 1-16 seed, in which 1 is the best seed ranking; there are 4 teams for each numerical ranking, meaning that there are 4 D-1 college basketball programs deemed a 1 seed, 4 deemed a 2 seed, and so on. Our group centered our research around the question, “How does regular season adjusted offensive efficiency and regular season adjusted defensive efficiency predict postseason seed?”. In the end, we found that in the regular season, teams with higher adjusted offensive efficiency & lower adjusted defensive efficiency will be predicted to have better seed assignments. This project utilized scatter plot visualizations, as well as additive and interactive models to justify our findings."

The study further analyzes the impact of various factors on squirrel visibility (such as weather conditions and food availability).\n\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\n\nThere is limited research on the variables which impact squirrel visibility. Our research question seeks to build upon this study’s research into the factors that influence squirrels’ propensity to venture into visible areas, specifically focusing on whether the presence of human spotters is a factor that influences squirrel visibility. If the presence of human spotters has a positive correlation with squirrels staying hidden or retreating, human presence may be an additional factor impacting squirrel visibility that ought be considered in future squirrel censuses."

The data is ever changing (with new information) and this data set was downloaded March 10th, 2023.\n\nWrite a brief description of the observations.\n\nThe observations look at the names, age, gender, ethnicity of the victims, if they were armed, where they were killed, and which agency they were killed by (Ex. which police station was the officer based in)."

However, one per data set is required.)\n\nWhich groups are more likely to be killed by police while looking at gender, armed status, race, and location?\n\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\n\nThis topic will look at which groups are more likely to be victims of 2016 deadly police violence. We will examine gender with regards to deadly police force, race, and also location by state. We hope this may be able to help us realize which areas in the country and which biases we should focus on first when solving the problem of deadly police force. We hypothesize that males, younger people, black people, and those from states with the highest population will be victims the most of deadly police force.\n\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\n\nGender (categorical) Age (quantitative) Race (categorical) City (categorical) State (categorical) Armed (if they were how were they armed) (categorical)"

It goes into detail of how race has a difference in statistics. More white people are killed when armed vs unarmed while black people are killed more when unarmed vs armed. Black people in 2015 and 2016 also are killed more as a percentage of unarmed people killed. It then goes on to say that off duty officers who are black are more likely to get killed than white officers by police violence. Next it looks into the psychology of this effect looking at things such as misinformation, weapon perception and shooter bias.\n\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\n\nThis builds on our question because it looks at race and armed status, but we will build on this by looking at specific locations as well as gender as well."
